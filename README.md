# Thyroid Cance Recurrence
Classification Model to Predict Thyroid Cancer Recurrence

Steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering with statistical testing to determine most relevant features
- Implementation of a machine learning model using XGBoost for classification, with stratified K-Fold cross validation since the dataset is imbalanced, and using 2 stage cross validation with regularization to avoid overfitting
- Model evaluation with Recall given the
